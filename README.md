BASIC DEMO:
Our project is basically a prototype of a shopping cart in which user can login to our the online store with a pre registered login credentials or they can make anew account and continue with the shopping. User can select items from the list of items and add them to their cart and then finalize their purchase by viewing the cart in the end and they can also remove any item if they want.

  
DATA STRUCTURES:
We used dictionaries, strings, lists and nested lists.

CONTRIBUTIONS:
Basically we worked on the project collectively since the start so the all three of us worked on every part of the code togethor via zoom meetings mostly so we cannot categorized it in a way that someone worked on X function and other worked on Y.
